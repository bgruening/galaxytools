            <![CDATA[
                Fiji is an image processing package.  It can be described as a "batteries-included" distribution of
                ImageJ (and ImageJ2), bundling Java, Java3D and a lot of plugins organized into a coherent menu structure.
                Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux.  The main focus of Fiji is to assist research in
                life sciences.
                
                ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program inspired by NIH Image for the Macintosh.
                It runs, either as an online applet or as a downloadable application, on any computer with a
                Java 1.4 or later virtual machine.
                
                It can display, edit, analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images. It can read
                many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM, FITS and "raw". It supports "stacks", a
                series of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming operations such
                as image file reading can be performed in parallel with other operations.
                
                See http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/intro.html
                
                NOTE: If you are planning to run ImageJ2 from the command line (unusual if using Galaxy) on Yosemite,
                then this version of fiji must be patched - see
