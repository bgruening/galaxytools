This package is a Galaxy workflow for merging of chemical libraries using the chemicaltoolbox.

To learn more about the chemicaltoolbox and all the integrated tools, 
please have a look at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/chemicaltoolbox.


What it does
============

Given one library, it extends all molecules by similar molecules of an other library and thus fill gaps in an automatic manner.
