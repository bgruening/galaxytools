This package is a Galaxy workflow for RNA sequence cross validation.

It uses the EDeN suite to train and test on a known set of
RNA sequences. The negative set of RNA sequences is shuffled
on the input dataset maintaining composition with shuffleseq (EMBOSS).

See http://www.galaxyproject.org for information about the Galaxy Project.
