Galaxy workflow for the identification of candidate genes clusters
------------------------------------------------------------------

This approach screens three proteins against a given genome sequence, leading to a genome position
were all three genes are located nearby. As usual in Galaxy workflows every
parameter, including the proximity distance, can be changed and additional steps
can be easily added. For example additional filtering to refine the initial BLAST
hits, or inclusion of a third query sequence.

Sample Data
===========

As an example, we will use three protein sequences from *Pan troglodytes* (Chimpanzee)
which are part of the β-globin cluster.

You can upload all sequences directly into Galaxy using the "Upload tool"
with either of these URLs - Galaxy should recognise this is FASTA files.

Query sequences:

* `P61920.fasta <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgruening/galaxytools/master/workflows/ncbi_blast_plus/find_three_genes_located_nearby/P61920.fasta>`_
* `P61921.fasta <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgruening/galaxytools/master/workflows/ncbi_blast_plus/find_three_genes_located_nearby/P61921.fasta>`_
* `Q6LDH1.fasta <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgruening/galaxytools/master/workflows/ncbi_blast_plus/find_three_genes_located_nearby/Q6LDH1.fasta>`_

In addition you can find the query sequences at the UniProt server:
