Galaxy wrapper for InterProScan 5 prediction tools
==================================================

InterProScan is a tool that combines different protein signature recognition methods native to the InterPro 
member databases into one resource with look up of corresponding InterPro and GO annotation.

This wrapper is copyright 2013 by:
 * Bjoern Gruening
