Bismark report for: /private/var/folders/cf/k7c5rjhj1sggk6x8z1jnw4b80000gp/T/tmpDiq_J8/files/000/dataset_2.dat (version: v0.19.1)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /private/var/folders/cf/k7c5rjhj1sggk6x8z1jnw4b80000gp/T/tmpe8nkca8w/ with the specified options: -q -L 20 -D 15 -R 2 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --quiet

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	44115
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	554
Mapping efficiency:	1.3%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	43115
Sequences did not map uniquely:	446
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	230	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	324	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
