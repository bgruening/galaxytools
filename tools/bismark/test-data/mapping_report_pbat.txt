Bismark report for: input_1.fq (version: v0.22.1)
Option '--pbat' specified: alignments to original strands (OT and OB) strands were ignored (i.e. not performed)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /tmp/tmpuqE7r1/ with the specified options: -q -L 20 -D 15 -R 2 --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --quiet

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	44115
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	13
Mapping efficiency:	0.0%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	44059
Sequences did not map uniquely:	43
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	0	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	0	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	11	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	2	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
