For Galaxy admins and local runs:

The databases for sylph have associated metadata files. These files MUST be paired with the correct databases to output correctly. Here is the easiest location to download databases and metadata files:
For databases: https://github.com/bluenote-1577/sylph/wiki/Pre%E2%80%90built-databases
For metadata: https://github.com/bluenote-1577/sylph-utils

The tool assumes the directory the data_table references to be
<name_of_organism>
    - database.syldb
    - metadata.tsv.gz
