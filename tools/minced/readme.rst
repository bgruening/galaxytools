MinCED - Mining CRISPRs in Environmental Datasets

MinCED is a program to find Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeats (CRISPRs) in full genomes or environmental datasets such as metagenomes,
in which sequence size can be anywhere from 100 to 800 bp. MinCED runs from the
command-line and was derived from CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt/):
  Charles Bland et al., CRISPR Recognition Tool (CRT): a tool for automatic
  detection of clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats, BMC
  Bioinformatics 8, no. 1 (2007): 209.
