  ImageJ2 is a new version of ImageJ for the next generation of multidimensional
  image data, with a focus on scientific imaging.  Its central goal is to broaden
  the paradigm of ImageJ beyond the limitations of ImageJ 1.x, to support the next
  generation of multidimensional scientific imaging.

  ImageJ2 is also a collection of reusable software libraries built on the SciJava
  software stack, using a powerful plugin framework to facilitate rapid development
  and painless user customization.

  The Fiji distribution of ImageJ has shipped with beta versions of ImageJ2 for
  quite some time.

    The ImageJ2 site is located at http://imagej.net/ImageJ2, and the Fiji site is
    at http://fiji.sc.  This ImageJ2 suite currently consists of the following tools.

    imagej2_adjust_threshold_binary - sets lower and upper threshold values,
    segmenting grayscale images into features of interest and background (see
    http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-28.html).

    imagej2_analyze_particles_binary - analyzes the particles in a segmented
    binary image, providing information about each particle in the image (see
    http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-29.html).

    imagej2_analyze_skeleton - tags all pixel/voxels in a skeleton image and
    then counts all its junctions, triple and quadruple points and branches,
    and measures their average and maximum length (see
    http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:analysis:analyzeskeleton:start).

    imagej2_binary_to_edm - wraps ImageJ2 EDM plugin, restricting use to the "toEDM"
    method (see https://github.com/imagej/imagej1/blob/master/ij/plugin/filter/EDM.java).

    imagej2_bunwarpj_adapt_transform - wraps the bUnwarpJ ImageJ2 plugin,
    restricting use to the "-adapt_transform" option when running bUnwarpJ
    from the command line (see http://biocomp.cnb.csic.es/~iarganda/bUnwarpJ).

    imagej2_bunwarpj_align - wraps the bUnwarpJ ImageJ2 plugin, restricting use
    to the "-align" option when running bUnwarpJ from the command line (see

    restricting use to the "-compare_elastic" option when running bUnwarpJ
    from the command line (see http://biocomp.cnb.csic.es/~iarganda/bUnwarpJ).

    imagej2_bunwarpj_compare_elastic_raw - wraps the bUnwarpJ ImageJ2 plugin,
