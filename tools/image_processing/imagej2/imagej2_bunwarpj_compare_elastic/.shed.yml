long_description: |
  Contains a tool that calculates the warping index of two opposite elastic transformations, i.e.
  the average of the geometrical distance between every pixel and its version after applying both
  transformations (direct and inverse). This value is given as a result. The transformation files
  must be in the same format format as the files created with the Save Transformation option in
  the Align two images with bUnwarpJ tool.
