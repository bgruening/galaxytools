**What it does**

<![CDATA[
Skeletonizes a 2D or 3D binary (8-bit) image. The underlying Skeletonize3D Fiji plugin works on grayscale
images, so other image types will automatically be converted to grayscale before they are analyzed.  This
step is performed using the ImageJ **Make Binary** command.  If images are not binary, all pixel values above
0 will be considered white. The resulting skeleton image will have pixel value 255 at the skeleton and 0 at
the background (black) pixels.

As Hanno Homman explains in his paper, binary thinning is used for ﬁnding the centerlines (”skeleton”) of
objects in the input image. The general idea is to erode the object’s surface iteratively until only the
skeleton remains. Erosion has to be performed symmetrically in order to the guarantee medial position of
the skeleton lines and such that the connectedness of the object is preserved. Care has to be taken in order
not to create holes or cavities in the object.

There are two major approaches to image thinning: a) kernel-based filters and b) decision trees. Kernel-based
filters apply a structuring element to the image and can generally be extended to dimensions higher than 3D,
to find computationally efficient solutions for 4D and higher dimensions is subject of ongoing research.
Methods based on decision trees are thus far limited to 2D and 3D, but are potentially faster than morphological
filters, if they are well designed and can ﬁnd more deletable points at each iteration.

In 3D there are 67,108,864 possible binary combinations of object and background voxels in a 26-neighborhood,
which cannot be completely captured by kernel-based filters. Lee et al. have demonstrated in their work that
their solution, based on a decision tree, can handle all these cases correctly and find all deletable surface
points at each iteration. Thus their algorithm allows for a very fast iterative erosion process.
