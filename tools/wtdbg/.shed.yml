  WTDBG is a fuzzy Bruijn graph (FBG) approach to long noisy reads assembly.
  A challenge in assembling long noisy reads from third generation sequencing (TGS) is reducing its requirement of computing resource, especially for large genomes. To address this issue, I developed a novel sequence alignment algorithm and a new assembly graph for efficiently assembling large genomes using TGS data.
