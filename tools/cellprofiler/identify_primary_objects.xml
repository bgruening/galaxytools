                        The min and max diameters are crucial for two reasons: first, the module uses it to calculate certain automatic settings in order to identify your objects of interest properly (see below). Second, when used in conjunction with the 'Discard objects outside the diameter range?' setting below, you can choose to remove objects outside the size range you provide here.

                                Reducing the texture of objects by increasing the smoothing increases the chance that each real, distinct object has only one peak of intensity but also increases the chance that two distinct objects will be recognized as only one object. Note that increasing the size of the smoothing filter increases the processing time exponentially.
                                Enter 0 to prevent any image smoothing in certain cases; for example, for low resolution images with small objects ( < ~5 pixels in diameter).

                            This setting allows you to choose the method that is used to draw the line between segmented objects, provided that you have chosen to declump the objects. To decide between these methods, you can run Test mode to see the results of each.
                            <br> - Intensity: Works best where the dividing lines between clumped objects are dimmer than the remainder of the objects.
                            <br> - Technical description: Using the previously identified local maxima as seeds, this method is a watershed (Vincent and Soille, 1991) on the intensity image.
                            <br> - Shape: Dividing lines between clumped objects are based on the shape of the clump. For example, when a clump contains two objects, the dividing line will be placed where indentations occur between the two objects. The intensity patterns in the original image are largely irrelevant: the cells need not be dimmer along the lines between clumped objects. Technical description: Using the previously identified local maxima as seeds, this method is a watershed on the distance-transformed thresholded image.
                            <br> - Propagate: This method uses a propagation algorithm instead of a watershed. The image is ignored and the pixels are assigned to the objects by repeatedly adding unassigned pixels to the objects that are immediately adjacent to them. This method is suited in cases such as objects with branching extensions, for instance neurites, where the goal is to trace outward from the cell body along the branch, assigning pixels in the branch along the way. See the help for the IdentifySecondaryObjects module for more details on this method.
                            <br> - None: If objects are well separated and bright relative to the background, it may be unnecessary to attempt to separate clumped objects. Using the very fast None option, a simple threshold will be used to identify objects.

                        The input image can be optionally smoothed before being thresholded.
                        Smoothing can improve the uniformity of the resulting objects, by removing holes and jagged edges caused by noise in the acquired image.
                        Smoothing is most likely not appropriate if the input image is binary, if it has already been smoothed or if it is an output of a pixel-based classifier.
                        The scale should be approximately the size of the artifacts to be eliminated by smoothing.
                        A Gaussian is used with a sigma adjusted so that 1/2 of the Gaussian’s distribution falls within the diameter given by the scale (sigma = scale / 0.674) Use a value of 0 for no smoothing.

                    The intensity threshold affects the decision of whether each pixel will be considered foreground (region(s) of interest) or background.
                    A higher threshold value will result in only the brightest regions being identified, whereas a lower threshold value will include dim regions.
                    When using the strategy "Global", you can have the threshold automatically calculated from a choice of several methods, however, when you choose "Adaptive" as the thresholding strategy, your only option is Otsu automatic thresholding.
                    The threshold that is used for each image is recorded as a per-image measurement, so if you are surprised by unusual measurements from one of your images, you might check whether the automatically calculated threshold was unusually high or low compared to the other images. See the FlagImage module if you would like to flag an image based on the threshold value.

                    <br> - Otsu: This approach calculates the threshold separating the two classes of pixels (foreground and background) by minimizing the variance within the each class.

                                The thresholding strategy determines the type of input that is used to calculate the threshold. These options allow you to calculate a threshold based on the whole image or based on image sub-regions.
                                The choices for the threshold strategy are:

                                <br> - Global: Calculates a single threshold value based on the unmasked pixels of the input image and use that value to classify pixels above the threshold as foreground and below as background.
                                image0 This strategy is fast and robust, especially if the background is relatively uniform (for example, after illumination correction).

                                <br> - Adaptive: Calculates a different threshold for each pixel, thus adapting to changes in foreground/background intensities across the image. For each pixel, the threshold is calculated based on the pixels within a given neighborhood (or window) surrounding that pixel.
                                image1 This method is slower but can produce better results for non-uniform backgrounds. However, for significant illumination variation, using the CorrectIllumination modules is preferable.

                                        Robust background calculates the variance, multiplies it by the value given by this setting and adds it to the average.
                                        Adding several deviations raises the threshold well above the average. Use a larger number to be more stringent about identifying foreground pixels.
                                        Use a smaller number to be less stringent. It’s even possible to use a negative number if you want the threshold to be lower than the average (e.g., for images that are densely covered by foreground).

                                This setting allows you to choose the method that is used to distinguish between individual objects that are touching each other (and not properly delineated as two objects by thresholding alone). In other words, this setting allows you to “declump” a large, merged object into individual objects of interest. To decide between these methods, you can run Test mode to see the results of each.
                                <br> - Intensity: For objects that tend to have only a single peak of brightness (e.g., objects that are brighter towards their interiors and dimmer towards their edges), this option counts each intensity peak as a separate object. The objects can be any shape, so they need not be round and uniform in size as would be required for the Shape option.
                                <br> - Shape: For cases when there are definite indentations separating objects. The image is converted to black and white (binary) and the shape determines whether clumped objects will be distinguished. The declumping results of this method are affected by the thresholding method you choose.
                                <br> - None: If objects are well separated and bright relative to the background, it may be unnecessary to attempt to separate clumped objects. Using the very fast None option, a simple threshold will be used to identify objects.

                                This setting deals with images that are segmented into an unreasonable number of objects. This might happen if the module calculates a low threshold or if the image has unusual artifacts. IdentifyPrimaryObjects can handle this condition in one of three ways:
                                <br> - Continue: Continue processing regardless if large numbers of objects are found.
                                <br> - Erase: Erase all objects if the number of objects exceeds the maximum. This results in an image with no primary objects. This option is a good choice if a large number of objects indicates that the image should not be processed; it can save a lot of time in subsequent Measure modules.

            **What it does**

            This tool identifies biological objects of interest. It requires grayscale images containing bright objects on a dark background. Incoming images must be 2D (including 2D slices of 3D images); please use the Watershed module for identification of objects in 3D.
