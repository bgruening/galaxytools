#This is a sample file distributed with Galaxy that is used to define huggingface
#models, using 7 columns tab separated
#(longer whitespace are TAB characters):
#
#The entries are as follows:
#
#<unique_build_id>	<display_name>	<pipeline_tag>	<domain>	<free_tag>	<version>	<folder_base_path>
#
#pipeline_tag (see this URL: https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image they call it that way)
#domain (defined by the Galaxy community, e.g. image / sequence / text)
#free_tag (not idea yet, but could be freely used by an admin to specify more filter options)
#version (if available)
#Your huggingface.loc file should include the huggingface cached model folder you have stored.
#For example:
#
#black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev	FLUX.1 [dev] is an open-weight, guidance-distilled model for non-commercial applications.	text-to-image	image	flux	1	/path/to/huggingface/that-contains/hub/models--black-forest-labs--FLUX.1-dev
#black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell	FLUX.1 [schnell] is the fastest model, tailored for personal use.	text-to-image	image	flux	1	/path/to/huggingface/that-contains/hub/models--black-forest-labs--FLUX.1-schnell
