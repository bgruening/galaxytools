    SAMBAMBA is a high performance modern robust and fast tool (and library), written in the D programming language, for working with SAM and BAM files. Current parallelised functionality is an important subset of samtools functionality, including view, index, sort, markdup, and depth. Because of efficient use of modern multicore CPUs, usually sambamba is much faster than samtools.
