long_description: LocARNA is a tool for multiple alignment of RNA molecules. From an RNA sequences it will simultaneously fold and align the input sequences. Specifications of additional constraints or fixed input structures are possible. The result is a multiple alignment together with a consensus structure. For the folding it makes use of a very realistic energy model for RNAs as it is by RNAfold of the Vienna RNA package (or Zuker's mfold). For the alignment it features RIBOSUM-like similarity scoring and realistic gap cost. http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/LocARNA/Input.jsp
