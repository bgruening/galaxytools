 LocARNA is distributed as source.

Latest Release: LocARNA 1.7.10

LocARNA runs on recent GNU/Linux systems. Installation follows the usual scheme:

http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/LocARNA/Releases/locarna-1.7.10.tar.gz

vorher das installieren
http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ronny/RNA/packages/source/ViennaRNA-2.1.4.tar.gz

tar xzf locarna-xxx.tar.gz
cd locarna-xxx

./configure
make
make install

LocARNA requires the Vienna RNA Package; a recent version is recommended.

For better performance, you may want to link to the Vienna RNA library (>= 2.1.1); for this purpose, add configure options
--with-vrna="path to VRNA installation" --enable-librna

See ./configure --help for further options.

Some systems require adding the path to LocARNA's library to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If libLocARNA is not found by the tools, extend the search path by

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(in bash; assuming locarna is installed in the default path /usr/local/lib.)
