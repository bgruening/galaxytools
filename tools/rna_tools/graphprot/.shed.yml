long_description: |
  GraphProt is a computational framework for learning sequence- and structure-binding preferences of 
  RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) from high-throughput experimental data such as CLIP-seq data.
  After model training, the learned sequence or structure models can be applied to predict RBP binding 
  profiles on FASTA sequences.
