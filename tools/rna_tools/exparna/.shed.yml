long_description: ExpaRNA is a fast, motif-based comparison and alignment tool for RNA molecules. Instead of computing a full sequence-structure alignment, it computes the best arrangement of sequence-structure motifs common to two RNAs. A motif is a local (or isolated) substructure which is identical to both RNAs. ExpaRNA requires a given nested secondary structure for both RNAs. If no structure is available, RNAfold from Vienna RNA Package is used for a structure prediction. The accuracy of the algorithm is mainly controlled by the minimal size of the included sequence-structure motifs. ExpaRNA is especially useful for comparative structural RNA analysis and to speed-up complex sequence-structure alignment methods. For this purpose, the predicted common substructures by ExpaRNA are used as anchor constraints for a full structural alignment. http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ExpaRNA/Input.jsp
