long_description: 
    This tool is used in the eCLIP sequence processing pipeline. Read in a '.bam' file where the first 9 nucleotides of the read name are the barcode and merge mapped
    to the same position that have the same barcode. Assumes paired end reads are adjacent to each other in the output file (i.e. only provide unsorted bams). It also 
    assumes that there are no multimappers in the bam file, if there are multimappers behavior is undefined.
