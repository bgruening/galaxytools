/**
 *  \brief Compute partition functions for locally stable secondary structures
 * 
 *  pfl_fold computes partition functions for every window of size
 *  'winSize' possible in a RNA molecule, allowing only pairs with a span
 *  smaller than 'pairSize'. It returns the mean pair probabilities averaged
 *  over all windows containing the pair in 'pl'. 'winSize' should
 *  always be >= 'pairSize'. Note that in contrast to Lfold(),
 *  bases outside of the window do not influence the structure at all. Only
 *  probabilities higher than 'cutoffb' are kept.
 * 
 *  If 'pU' is supplied (i.e is not the NULL pointer), pfl_fold()
 *  will also compute the mean probability that regions of length 'u' and smaller are 
 *  unpaired. The parameter 'u' is supplied in 'pup[0][0]'. On return
 *  the 'pup' array will contain these probabilities, with the entry on
 *  'pup[x][y]' containing the mean probability that x and the y-1
 *  preceding bases are unpaired. The 'pU' array needs to be large
 *  enough to hold n+1 float* entries, where n is the sequence length.
 * 
 *  If an array dpp2 is supplied, the probability of base pair (i,j)
 *  given that there already exists a base pair (i+1,j-1) is also
 *  computed and saved in this array. If pUfp is given (i.e. not NULL), pU
 *  is not saved but put out imediately. If spup is given (i.e. is not NULL),
 *  the pair probabilities in pl are not saved but put out imediately.
