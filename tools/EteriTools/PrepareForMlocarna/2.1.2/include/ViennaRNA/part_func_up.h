 *  \brief Partition Function Cofolding as stepwise process
 * 
 *  In this approach to cofolding the interaction between two RNA molecules is
 *  seen as a stepwise process. In a first step, the target molecule has to
 *  adopt a structure in which a binding site is accessible. In a second step,
 *  the ligand molecule will hybridize with a region accessible to an
 *  interaction. Consequently the algorithm is designed as a two step process:
 *  The first step is the calculation of the probability
 *  that a region within the target is unpaired, or equivalently, the
 *  calculation of the free energy needed to expose a region. In the second step
 *  we compute the free energy of an interaction for every possible binding site.

/**
 *  \brief Calculate the partition function over all unpaired regions

 * 
 *  You have to call function pf_fold() providing the same sequence before calling
 *  pf_unstru(). If you want to calculate unpaired regions for a constrained structure, set
 *  variable 'structure' in function 'pf_fold()' to the constrain string.
 *  It returns a #pu_contrib struct containing four arrays of dimension
 *  [i = 1 to length(sequence)][j = 0 to u-1] containing all possible contributions
 *  to the probabilities of unpaired regions of maximum length u.
 *  Each array in #pu_contrib contains one of the contributions to the
 *  total probability of being unpaired: The probability of being unpaired
 *  within an exterior loop is in array #pu_contrib->E, the probability
 *  of being unpaired within a hairpin loop is in array #pu_contrib->H,
 *  the probability of being unpaired within an interior loop is in array
 *  #pu_contrib->I and probability of being unpaired within a multi-loop
 *  is in array #pu_contrib->M. The total probability of being unpaired
 *  is the sum of the four arrays of #pu_contrib.
 * 
 *  This function frees everything allocated automatically. To
 *  free the output structure call free_pu_contrib().

/**
 *  \brief Calculates the probability of a local interaction between two sequences.
 * 
 *  The function considers the probability that the
 *  region of interaction is unpaired within 's1' and 's2'. The
 *  longer sequence has to be given as 's1'. The shorter sequence has to
 *  be given as 's2'. Function pf_unstru() has to be called
 *  for 's1' and 's2', where the probabilities of  being unpaired
 *  have to be given in 'p_c' and 'p_c2', respectively. If you do
 *  not want to include the probabilities of  being unpaired for 's2' set
 *  'p_c2' to NULL. If variable 'cstruc' is not NULL,
 *  constrained folding is done: The available constrains for intermolecular
 *  interaction are: '.' (no constrain), 'x' (the base has no intermolecular
 *  interaction) and '|' (the corresponding base has to be paired
 *  intermolecularily).\n
 *  The parameter 'w' determines the maximal length of the interaction. The
 *  parameters 'incr5' and 'incr3' allows inclusion of
 *  unpaired residues left ('incr5') and right ('incr3') of the region
 *  of interaction in 's1'. If the 'incr' options are used, function
 *  pf_unstru() has to be called with
 *  w=w+incr5+incr3 for the longer sequence 's1'.
 * 
 *  It returns a structure of type #interact which
 *  contains the probability of the best local interaction including residue i
 *  in Pi and the minimum free energy in Gi, where i is the position in sequence
 *  's1'. The member Gikjl of structure #interact is
 *  the best interaction between region [k,i] k<i in longer sequence
 *  's1' and region [j,l] j<l in 's2'. Gikjl_wo is Gikjl without the
 *  probability of beeing unpaired.\n
 *  Use free_interact() to free the returned structure, all
 *  other stuff is freed inside pf_interact().
