.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAup 2.1.2
.PP
Calculate the thermodynamics of RNA\-RNA interactions
.PP
RNAup calculates the thermodynamics of RNA\-RNA interactions, by decomposing the
binding into two stages. (1) First the probability that a potential binding
sites remains unpaired (equivalent to the free energy needed to open the site)
is computed. (2) Then this accessibility is combined with the interaction
energy to obtain the total binding energy. All calculations are done by
computing partition functions over all possible conformations.
.PP

RNAup provides two different modes: By default RNAup computes accessibilities,
in terms of the free energies needed to open a region (default length 4). It
prints the region of highest accessibility and its opening energy to stdout,
opening energies for all other regions are written to a file.

.br
In interaction mode the interaction between two RNAs is calculated. It is
invoked if the input consists of two sequences concatenated with an "&",
or if the options -X[pf] or -b are given. Unless the -b option is specified
RNAup assumes that the longer RNA is a structured target sequence
while the shorter one is an unstructured small RNA.
.br
Additionally, for every position along the target sequence we write the best
free energy of binding for an interaction that includes this position to the
the output file.
Output to stdout consists of the location and free energy, dG,
for the optimal region of interaction. The binding energy dG is also split into
its components the interaction energy dGint and the opening energy dGu_l (and
possibly dGu_s for the shorter sequence).
.br
In addition we print the optimal interaction structure as computed by RNAduplex
for this region. Note that it can happen that the RNAduplex computed optimal
interaction does not coincide with the optimal RNAup region. If the two
predictions don't match the structure string is replaced by a run of "."
and a message is written to stderr.
.br

Each sequence should be in 5' to 3' direction. If the sequence is preceded
by a line of the form
.nf
.ft CW
> name
.ft
.fi

the output file "name_ux_up.out" is produced, where the "x" in "ux" is the
value set by the -u option. Otherwise the file name defaults to
RNA_ux_up.out. The output is concatenated if a file with the same name exists.
.br

RNA sequences are read from stdin as strings of characters. White space and
newline within a sequence cause an error! Newline is used to separate
sequences. The program will continue to read new sequences until a line
consisting of the single character @ or an end of file condition is
encountered.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR
Calculate structures subject to constraints.
(default=off)
.IP
The program reads first the sequence(s), then a string containing constraints
on the structure encoded with the symbols:
.IP
\&. (no constraint for this base)
.IP
x (the base is unpaired)
< (base i is paired with a base j>i) (solely used for calculation of
.IP
unpaired regions)
.IP
\f(CW> (base i is paired with a base j<i) (solely used for calculation of\fR
.IP
unpaired regions)
.IP
( ) (base i pairs base j)
| (the corresponding base has to be paired intermolecularily (works only in
.IP
interaction mode)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-no_output_file\fR
Do not produce an output file
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-no_header\fR
Do not produce a header with the command line
parameters used in the outputfile
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide "T"
with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Calculations of opening energies:"
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-ulength\fR=\fIlength\fR
specifies the length of the unstructured region
in the output.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
The probability of being unpaired is plotted on the right border of the
unpaired region. You can specify up to 20 different length values: use "\-"
to specify a range of continuous values (e.g. \fB\-u\fR 4\-8) or specify a list of
comma separated values (e.g. \fB\-u\fR 4,8,15).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-contributions\fR=\fISHIME\fR
Specify the contributions listed in the output
(default=`S')
.IP
By default only the full probability of being unpaired is plotted. The \fB\-c\fR
option allows to get the different contributions (c) to the probability of
being unpaired: The full probability of being unpaired ("S" is the sum of
the probability of being unpaired in the exterior loop ("E"), within a
hairpin loop ("H"), within an interior loop ("I") and within a multiloop
("M"). Any combination of these letters may be given.
.SS "Calculations of RNA-RNA interactions:"
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-window\fR=\fIINT\fR
Determine the maximal length of the region of
interaction
.IP
(default=`25')
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-include_both\fR
Include the probability of unpaired regions in
both (b) RNAs. By default
only the probability of being unpaired in the
longer RNA (target) is used.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-5\fR, \fB\-\-extend5\fR=\fIINT\fR
Extend the region of interaction in the target to
some residues on the 5' side
.IP
The underlying assumption is that it is favorable for an interaction if not
only the direct region of contact is unpaired but also a few residues 5'
.TP
\fB\-3\fR, \fB\-\-extend3\fR=\fIINT\fR
Extend the region of interaction in the target to
some residues on the 3' side
.IP
The underlying assumption is that it is favorable for an interaction if not
only the direct region of contact is unpaired but also a few residues 3'
.TP
\fB\-\-interaction_pairwise\fR
Activate pairwise interaction mode
(default=off)
.IP
The first sequence interacts with the 2nd, the third with the 4th etc. If
activated, two interacting sequences may be given in a single line separated
by "&" or each sequence may be given on an extra line.
.TP
\fB\-\-interaction_first\fR
Activate interaction mode using first sequence
only
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The interaction of each sequence with the first one is calculated (e.g.
interaction of one mRNA with many small RNAs). Each sequence has to be given
on an extra line
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as an
estimate for the ensemble free energy (used to
avoid overflows). The default is 1.07, useful
values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use
double precision (see the README file).
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on
both sides in any case.
.IP
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices
of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR
1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.SH EXAMPLES

.B Output to stdout:

In Interaction mode RNAup prints the most favorable interaction energy
between the two sequences to stdout. The most favorable interaction energy
(dG) depends on the position in the longer sequence (region [i,j]) and the
position in the shorter sequence (region[k,l]): dG[i,j;k,l].  dG[i,j;k,l] is the
largest contribution to dG[i,j] = sum_kl dG[i,j;k,l] which is given in the
output file: therefore dG[i,j;k,l] <= dG[i,j].

.B Output to file:

Output to file contains a header including date, the command line of the
call to RNAup, length and names of the input sequence(s) followed
by the sequence(s). The first sequence is the target sequence.
Printing of the header can be turned off using the -nh option.

The line directly after the header gives the column names for the output:

.nf
.ft CW
  position     dGu_l for -u 3      dGu_l for -u 4       dG
#     pos      u3S       u3H       u4S       u4H        dG
.ft
.fi

where all information refers to the target sequence. The dGu_l column contains
information about the -u value (u=3 or u=4) and the contribution to the free
energy to open all structures "S" or only hairpin loops "H", see option -c.
NA means that no results is possible (e.g. column u3S row 2: no region of
length 3 ending at position 2 exists).

If the -b option is selected position and dGu_s values for the shorter sequence
are written after the information for the target sequence.
