RNA2Dfold 2.1.2
.PP
Compute MFE structure, partition function and representative sample structures
of k,l neighborhoods
.PP
The program partitions the secondary structure space into (basepair)distance
classes according to two fixed reference structures. It expects a sequence and
two secondary structures in dot\-bracket notation as its inputs. For each
distance class, the MFE representative, Boltzmann probabilities and Gibbs free
energy is computed. Additionally, a stochastic backtracking routine allows to
produce samples of representative suboptimal secondary structures from each
partition
