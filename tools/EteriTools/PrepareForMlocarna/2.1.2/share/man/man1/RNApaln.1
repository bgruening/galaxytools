.SH DESCRIPTION
RNApaln 2.1.2
.PP
RNA alignment based on sequence base pairing propensities
.PP
Uses string\-alignment techniques to perform fast pairwise structural alignments
of RNAs. Similar to RNApdist secondary structure is incorporated in an
approximate manner by computing base pair probabilities, which are then reduced
to a vector holding the probability that a base is paired upstream, downstream,
or remains unpaired. Such pair propsensity vectors can then be compared using
standard alignment algorithms. In contrast to RNApdist, RNApaln performs
similarity (instead of distance) alignments, considers both sequence and
structure information, and uses affine (rather than linear) gap costs. RNApaln
can perform semi\-local alignments by using free end gaps, a true local
alignment mode is planned.
.PP
The same approach has since been used in the StraL program from Gerhard
Steeger's group. Since StraL has optimized parameters and a multiple alignment
mode, it be be currently the better option.

options, and exit

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-printAlignment\fR[=\fIfilename\fR]
Print an "alignment" with gaps of the
.IP
profiles
The aligned structures are written to
filename, if specified
Otherwise output is written to stdout, unless
the \fB\-Xm\fR option is set in which case
"backtrack.file" is used.
.IP
(default=`stdout')
.IP
The following symbols are used:
.TP
(
)  essentially upstream (downstream) paired bases
.TP
{
}  weakly upstream (downstream) paired bases
.TP
|
strongly paired bases without preference
.TP
,
weakly paired bases without preference
.TP
\&.
essentially unpaired bases.
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide
"T" with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
.TP
\fB\-X\fR, \fB\-\-mode\fR=\fIpmfc\fR
Set the alignment mode to be used
.IP
The alignment mode is passed as a single character value. The following
options are available:
\&'p' \- Compare the structures pairwise, that is first with 2nd, third with 4th
etc. This is the default.
.TP
\&'m'
\- Calculate the distance matrix between all structures. The output is
.IP
formatted as a lower triangle matrix.
.IP
\&'f' \- Compare each structure to the first one.
.IP
\&'c' \- Compare continuously, that is i\-th with (i+1)th structure.
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-\-gapo\fR=\fIopen\fR
Set the gap open penalty
.TP
\fB\-\-gape\fR=\fIext\fR
Set the gap extension penalty
.TP
\fB\-\-seqw\fR=\fIw\fR
Set the weight of sequence (compared to
structure) in the scoring function.
.TP
\fB\-\-endgaps\fR
Use free end\-gaps
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
