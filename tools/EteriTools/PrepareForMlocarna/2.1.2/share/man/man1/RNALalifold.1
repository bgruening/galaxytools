.SH DESCRIPTION
RNALalifold 2.1.2
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structures for a set of aligned RNAs
.PP
reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculates locally
stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span. For a sequence of
length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only O(n+L*L) memory and
O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very large genomes for
short RNA
.IP
structures.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-span\fR=\fIINT\fR
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base
pair to span. I.e. no pairs (i,j) with
j\-i>span will be allowed.
.IP
(default=`70')
.TP
\fB\-\-csv\fR
Create comma seperated output (csv)
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partfunc\fR[=\fIINT\fR]
Calculate the partition function and base
pairing probability matrix in addition to the
mfe structure.  (default=`1')
.IP
Default is calculation of mfe structure only. In addition to the MFE
structure we print a coarse representation of the pair probabilities in form
of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by the ensemble free energy, as well
as the centroid structure derived from the pair probabilities together with
its free energy and distance to the ensemble. Finally it prints the frequency
of the mfe structure.
.IP
An additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition
function calculation:
\fB\-p0\fR \etCalculate the partition function but not the pair probabilities, saving
about 50% in runtime. This prints the ensemble free energy \fB\-kT\fR ln(Z).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cutoff\fR=\fIFLOAT\fR
Report only base pairs with an average
probability > cutoff in the dot plot
.IP
(default=`0.01')
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fIscaling\fR factor
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as
an estimate for the ensemble free energy
(used to avoid overflows).
.IP
The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file).
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus: For each column of the
alignment output the set of nucleotides with
frequence greater than average in IUPAC
notation.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is unsupported for the partition function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-cfactor\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-nfactor\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in
the covariance term of the energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_file\fR=\fIribosumfile\fR
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal
.IP
energy model. Matrixes to use should be 6x6
matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG,
GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_scoring\fR
use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is
chosen according to the minimal and maximal
pairwise identities of the sequences in the
file.
.IP
(default=off)
