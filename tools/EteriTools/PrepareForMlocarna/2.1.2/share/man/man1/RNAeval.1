[\fIOPTIONS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAeval 2.1.2
.PP
calculate energy of RNA sequences with given secondary structure
.PP
Evaluates the free energy of an RNA molecule in fixed secondary structure.
Sequences and structures are read alternately from stdin. The energy in
Kcal/Mol is written to stdout.
The program will continue to read new sequences and structures until a line
consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition is
encountered.
If the input sequence or structure contains the separator character "&" the
program calculates the energy of the co\-folding of two RNA strands, where the
"&" marks the boundary between the two strands.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-detailed\-help\fR
Print help, including all details and hidden
options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit
.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide "T"
with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print out energy contribution of each loop in the
structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp
C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop hairpins.
Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this unsupported for the partition function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR
1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-logML\fR
Recalculate energies of structures using a
logarithmic energy function for multi\-loops
before output.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
This option does not effect structure generation, only the energies that are
printed out. Since logML lowers energies somewhat, some structures may be
missing.
