.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fIOPTIONS\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAplfold 2.1.2
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structure \- pair probabilities
.PP
Computes local pair probabilities for base pairs with a maximal span of L. The
probabilities are averaged over all windows of size L that contain the base
pair. For a sequence of length n and a window size of L the algorithm uses only
O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very
large genomes for short stable RNA structures.
.PP

Output consists of a dot plot in postscript file, where the averaged pair probabilities
can easily be parsed and visually inspected.

The -u option makes i possible to compute the probability that a stretch of x consequtive
nucleotides is unpaired, which is useful for predicting possible binding sites. Again
this probability is averaged over all windows containing the region.

.B WARNING! Output format changed!!

The output is a plain text matrix containing on each line a position i followed by the
probability that i is unpaired, [i-1..i] is unpaired [i-2..i] is unpaired and so on to
the probability that [i-x+1..i] is unpaired.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-winsize\fR=\fIsize\fR
Average the pair probabilities over windows of
given size
.IP
(default=`70')
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-span\fR=\fIsize\fR
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base pair
to span. I.e. no pairs (i,j) with j\-i > span
will be allowed. Defaults to winsize if
parameter is omitted
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cutoff\fR=\fIFLOAT\fR
Report only base pairs with an average probability
> cutoff in the dot plot
.IP
(default=`0.01')
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-print_onthefly\fR
Save memory by printing out everything during
computation.
NOTE: activated per default for sequences over
1M bp.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-ulength\fR=\fIlength\fR
Compute the mean probability that regions of
length 1 to a given length are unpaired. Output
is saved in a _lunp file.
.IP
(default=`31')
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-opening_energies\fR
Switch output from probabilities to their
logarithms, which are NOT exactly the mean
energies needed to the respective stretch of
bases!
NOTE: This actives \fB\-u\fR option.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-plex_output\fR
Create additional output files for RNAplex.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide "T"
with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp
C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop hairpins.
Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on
both sides in any case.
.HP
\fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices
of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binaries\fR
Output accessibility profiles in binary format
\&.  (default=off)
.IP
The binary files produced by RNAplfold do not need to be parsed by RNAplex,
.IP
so that they are directly loaded into memory. This is useful when large
sequences have to be searched for putative hybridization sites. An other
advantage of the binary format is the 50% file size decrease.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR
1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-betaScale\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the scaling of the Boltzmann factors
(default=`1.')
.IP
The argument provided with this option enables to scale the thermodynamic
temperature used in the Boltzmann factors independently from the temperature
used to scale the individual energy contributions of the loop types. The
Boltzmann factors then become exp(\fB\-dG\fR/(kT*betaScale)) where k is the
Boltzmann constant, dG the free energy contribution of the state and T the
absolute temperature.
