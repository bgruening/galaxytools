.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAinverse 2.1.2
.PP
Find RNA sequences with given secondary structure
.PP
The program searches for sequences folding into a predefined structure, thereby
inverting the folding algorithm. Target structures (in bracket notation) and
starting sequences for the search are read alternately from stdin.
Characters in the start sequence other than "AUGC" (or the alphabet specified
with \fB\-a\fR) will be treated as wild cards and replaced by a random character. Any
lower case characters in the start sequence will be kept fixed during the
search. If necessary, the sequence will be elongated to the length of the
structure. Thus a string of "N"s as well as a blank line specify a random
start sequence.
For each search the best sequence found and its Hamming distance to the start
sequence are printed to stdout. If the the search was unsuccessful, a structure
distance to the target is appended.
The \fB\-Fp\fR and \fB\-R\fR options can modify the output format, see commandline options
below.
The program will continue to read new structures and sequences until a line
consisting of the single character "@" or an end of file condition is
encountered.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-detailed\-help\fR
Print help, including all details and hidden
options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-full\-help\fR
Print help, including hidden options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-repeat\fR[=\fIINT\fR]
Search repeatedly for the same structure.
If an argument is supplied to this option it
must follow the option flag immediately. E.g.:
\fB\-R5\fR
.IP
(default=`100')
.IP
If repeats is negative search until \fB\-\-repeats\fR exact solutions are found, no
output is done for unsuccessful searches. Be aware, that the program will not
terminate if the target structure can not be found.
If no value is supplied with this option, the default value is used.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-alphabet\fR=\fIALPHABET\fR
Find sequences using only nucleotides from a given
alphabet.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
In conjunction with a negative value supplied to
\fB\-R\fR, print the last subsequence and substructure
for each unsuccessful search.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-function\fR=\fImp\fR
Use minimum energy (\fB\-Fm\fR), partition function
folding (\fB\-Fp\fR) or both (\fB\-Fmp\fR).
.IP
(default=`m')
.IP
In partition function mode, the probability of the target structure
exp(\fB\-E\fR(S)/kT)/Q is maximized. This probability is written in brackets after
the found sequence and Hamming distance. In most cases you'll want to use the
\fB\-f\fR option in conjunction with \fB\-Fp\fR, see below.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-final\fR=\fIFLOAT\fR
In combination with \fB\-Fp\fR stop search when sequence
is found with E(s)\-F is smaller than final,
where F=\-kT*ln(Q).
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp
C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop hairpins.
Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is unsupported for the partition function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-Fp\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR
1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
