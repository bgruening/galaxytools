.SH DESCRIPTION
RNALfold 2.1.2
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structures of RNAs
.PP
Compute locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span.
For a sequence of length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only
O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very
large genomes for short RNA structures.
Output consists of a list of secondary structure components of size <= L, one
entry per line. Each output line contains the predicted local structure its
energy in kcal/mol and the starting position of the local structure.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-span\fR=\fIINT\fR
Set the maximum allowed separation of a base pair
to span. I.e. no pairs (i,j) with j\-i>span will
be allowed.
.IP
(default=`150')
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide "T"
with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zscore\fR[=\fIDOUBLE\fR]
Activate z\-score computation. An optional argument
may be supplied to set the threshold
Due to parsing the commandline parameters a
negative value should be given immediately after
"z" without spaces e.g. \fB\-z\-4\fR.9
.IP
(default=`\-2')
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp
C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop hairpins.
Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices
of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR
1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
