.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAaliduplex 2.1.2
.PP
Predict conserved RNA\-RNA interactions between two alignments
.PP
The program reads two alignments of RNA sequences in CLUSTAL format and
predicts optimal and suboptimal binding sites, hybridization energies and the
corresponding structures. The calculation takes only inter\-molecular base pairs
into account, for the general case use RNAcofold. The use of alignments allows
to focus on binding sites that are evolutionary conserved. Note, that the two
input alignments need to have equal number of sequences and the same order,
i.e. the 1st sequence in file1 will be hybridized to the 1st in file2 etc.
.PP
The computed binding sites, energies, and structures are written to stdout, one
structure per line. Each line consist of: The structure in dot bracket format
with a "&" separating the two strands. The range of the structure in the two
sequences in the format  "from,to : from,to"; the energy of duplex structure
in kcal/mol.
The format is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure between a
small probe sequence and a long target sequence.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-deltaEnergy\fR=\fIrange\fR
Compute suboptimal structures with energy in a
certain range of the optimum (kcal/mol). Default
is calculation of mfe structure only.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sorted\fR
print output sorted by free energy
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp
C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop hairpins.
Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases
adjacent to helices in free ends and multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end,
this is the default for mfe folding but unsupported for the partition
function folding.
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for
partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that by default (as well as with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR) pf and mfe folding treat
dangling ends differently. Use \fB\-d2\fR in addition to \fB\-p\fR to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices
of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitude nucleotide "T"
with "U"
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of
using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
