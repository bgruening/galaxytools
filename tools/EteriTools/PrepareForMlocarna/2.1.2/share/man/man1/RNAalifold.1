[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<file1.aln>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAalifold 2.1.2
.PP
calculate secondary structures for a set of aligned RNAs
.PP
Read aligned RNA sequences from stdin or file.aln and calculate their minimum
free energy (mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base pairing
probability matrix. Currently, the input alignment has to be in CLUSTAL format.
It returns the mfe structure in bracket notation, its energy, the free energy
of the thermodynamic ensemble and the frequency of the mfe structure in the
ensemble to stdout.  It also produces Postscript files with plots of the
resulting secondary structure graph ("alirna.ps") and a "dot plot" of the
base pairing matrix ("alidot.ps"). The file "alifold.out" will contain a
list of likely pairs sorted by credibility, suitable for viewing  with
"AliDot.pl". Be warned that output file will overwrite any existing files of
the same name.

.SS "General Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR
Calculate structures subject to constraints.
The constraining structure will be read from
\&'stdin', the alignment has to be given as a
file name on the command line.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
the structure encoded with the symbols:
.IP
\&. (no constraint for this base)
.IP
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
.IP
x (the base is unpaired)
.IP
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
.IP
\f(CW> (base i is paired with a base j<i)\fR
.IP
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
.IP
With the exception of "|", constraints will disallow all pairs conflicting
with the constraint. This is usually sufficient to enforce the constraint,
but occasionally a base may stay unpaired in spite of constraints. PF folding
ignores constraints of type "|".
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR
Produce a colored version of the consensus
strcture plot "alirna.ps" (default b&w
only)
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-aln\fR
Produce a colored and structure annotated
alignment in PostScript format in the file
"aln.ps" in the current directory.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noPS\fR
Do not produce postscript output
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-partfunc\fR[=\fIINT\fR]
Calculate the partition function and base
pairing probability matrix in addition to the
mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe
structure only.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
In addition to the MFE structure we print a coarse representation of the pair
probabilities in form of a pseudo bracket notation, followed by the ensemble
free energy, as well as the centroid structure derived from the pair
probabilities together with its free energy and distance to the ensemble.
Finally it prints the frequency of the mfe structure.
.IP
An additionally passed value to this option changes the behavior of partition
function calculation:
\fB\-p0\fR deactivates the calculation of the pair probabilities, saving about 50%
in runtime. This prints the ensemble free energy \fB\-kT\fR ln(Z).
.TP
\fB\-\-MEA\fR[=\fIgamma\fR]
Calculate an MEA (maximum expected accuracy)
structure.
.IP
(default=`1.')
.IP
If gamma is not specified a default of gamma=1 is used.
Using \fB\-\-MEA\fR implies \fB\-p\fR
See also RNAfold man page for details.
.TP
\fB\-\-mis\fR
Output "most informative sequence" instead of
simple consensus: For each column of the
alignment output the set of nucleotides with
frequence greater than average in IUPAC
notation.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stochBT\fR=\fIINT\fR
Stochastic backtrack. Compute a certain number
of random structures with a probability
dependend on the partition function. See \fB\-p\fR
option in RNAsubopt.
.TP
\fB\-\-stochBT_en\fR=\fIINT\fR
same as "\-s" but also print out the energies
and probabilities of the backtraced
structures.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-pfScale\fR=\fIscaling\fR factor
In the calculation of the pf use scale*mfe as
an estimate for the ensemble free energy
(used to avoid overflows).
.IP
The default is 1.07, useful values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for
long sequences.
You can also recompile the program to use double precision (see the README
file).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circ\fR
Assume a circular (instead of linear) RNA
molecule.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-bppmThreshold=\fR<value>
Set the threshold for base pair probabilities
included in the postscript output
.IP
(default=`1e\-6')
.IP
By setting the threshold the base pair probabilities that are included in the
output can be varied. By default only those exceeding 1e\-5 in probability
will be shown as squares in the dot plot. Changing the threshold to any other
value allows for increase or decrease of data.
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Model Details:"
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins. Mostly for testing.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fIINT\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on
both sides
.IP
in any case.
.IP
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-cfactor\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the weight of the covariance term in the
energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-\-nfactor\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in
the covariance term of the energy function
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-endgaps\fR
Score pairs with endgaps same as gap\-gap pairs.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_file\fR=\fIribosumfile\fR
use specified Ribosum Matrix instead of normal
.IP
energy model. Matrixes to use should be 6x6
matrices, the order of the terms is AU, CG,
GC, GU, UA, UG.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-ribosum_scoring\fR
use ribosum scoring matrix. The matrix is
chosen according to the minimal and maximal
pairwise identities of the sequences in the
file.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-old\fR
use old energy evaluation, treating gaps as
characters.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs.
e.g. RNAfold \fB\-nsp\fR \fB\-GA\fR  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fIINT\fR
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the
artificial ABCD... alphabet, where A pairs B,
C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC
(\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR 2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-betaScale\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the scaling of the Boltzmann factors
(default=`1.')
.IP
The argument provided with this option enables to scale the thermodynamic
temperature used in the Boltzmann factors independently from the temperature
used to scale the individual energy contributions of the loop types. The
Boltzmann factors then become exp(\fB\-dG\fR/(kTn*betaScale)) where k is the
Boltzmann constant, dG the free energy contribution of the state, T the
absolute temperature and n the number of sequences.
.PP
Caveats:
.PP
Sequences are not weighted. If possible, do not mix very similar and dissimilar
sequences. Duplicate sequences, for example, can distort the prediction.
