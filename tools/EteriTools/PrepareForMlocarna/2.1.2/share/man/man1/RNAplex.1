.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNAplex
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAplex 2.1.2
.PP
Find targets of a query RNA
.PP
reads two RNA sequences from stdin or <filename> and computes optimal and
suboptimal secondary structures for their hybridization. The calculation is
simplified by allowing only inter\-molecular base pairs. Accessibility effects
can be estimated by RNAplex if a RNAplfold accessibility profile is provided.
The computed optimal and suboptimal structure are written to stdout, one
structure per line. Each line consist of: The structure in dot bracket format
with a "&" separating the two strands. The range of the structure in the two
sequences in the format  "from,to : from,to"; the energy of duplex structure
in kcal/mol.
The format is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure between a
small probe sequence and a long target sequence.

.SS "Input Options:"
.IP
Below are command line options which alter the general input behavior of this
program
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR=\fISTRING\fR
File containing the query sequence.
.IP
Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a query file with
the \fB\-q\fR option. Note that the \fB\-q\fR option implies that the \fB\-t\fR option is also
used
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-target\fR=\fISTRING\fR
File containing the target sequence.
.IP
Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a target file with
the \fB\-t\fR option. Note that the \fB\-t\fR option implies that the \fB\-q\fR option is also
used
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-accessibility\-dir\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Location of the accessibility profiles.
.IP
This option switches the accessibility modes on and indicates in which
directory accessibility profiles as generated by RNAplfold can be found
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
Allow the reading and parsing of memory dumped
opening energy file
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The \fB\-b\fR option allows to read and process opening energy files which are saved
in binary format
.IP
This can reduce by a factor of 500x\-1000x the time needed to process those
.IP
files. RNAplex recognizes the corresponding opening energy files by looking
for files named after the sequence and containing the suffix _openen_bin.
Please look at the man page of RNAplfold if you need more information on how
to produce binary opening energy files.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fIparamfile\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
A sample parameter file should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Options which alter the computing behaviour of RNAplex.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature T.
Default is 37C.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-interaction\-length\fR=\fIINT\fR
Maximal length of an interaction
(default=`40')
.IP
Maximal allowed length of an interaction
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-extension\-cost\fR=\fIINT\fR
Cost to add to each nucleotide in a duplex
(default=`0')
.IP
Cost of extending a duplex by one nucleotide. Allows to find compact
duplexes, having few/small bulges or interior loops Only useful when no
accessibility profiles are available. This option is disabled if
accessibility profiles are used (\fB\-a\fR option)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-probe\-mode\fR
Compute Tm for probes  (default=off)
.IP
Use this option if you want to compute the melting temperature of your probes
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-probe\-concentration\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the probe concentration for the Tm
.IP
computation
.IP
(default=`0.1')
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-na\-concentration\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR Set the Na+ concentration for the Tm
computation
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-mg\-concentration\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR Set the Mg2+ concentration for the Tm
computation
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-K\fR, \fB\-\-k\-concentration\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the K+ concentration for the Tm computation
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-tris\-concentration\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Set the tris+ concentration for the Tm
.IP
computation
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fast\-folding\fR=\fIINT\fR
Speedup of the target search
(default=`0')
.IP
This option allows to decide if the backtracking has to be done (\fB\-f\fR 0, \fB\-f\fR 2)
or not (\fB\-f\fR 1). For \fB\-f\fR 0 the structure is computed based on the standard
energy model. This is the slowest and most precise mode of RNAplex. With \fB\-f\fR
2, the structure is computed based on the approximated plex model. If a lot
of targets are returned this is can greatly improve the runtime of RNAplex.
\fB\-f\fR 1 is the fastest mode, as no structure are recomputed
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-scale\-accessibility\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR
Rescale all opening energy by a factor V
.IP
(default=`1.0')
.IP
Scale\-factor for the accessibility. If V is set to 1 then the scaling has no
effect on the accessibility.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-constraint\fR
Calculate structures subject to constraints.
(default=off)
.IP
The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
the structure for the query sequence encoded with the symbols:
\&. (no constraint for this base)
| (the corresponding base has to be paired)
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-alignment\-mode\fR
Tells RNAplex to compute interactions based on
alignments
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
If the A option is set RNAplex expects clustalw files as input for the \fB\-q\fR and
\fB\-t\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-convert\-to\-bin\fR
If set, RNAplex will convert all opening energy
file in a directory set by the \fB\-a\fR option into
binary opening energy files
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
RNAplex can be used to convert existing text formatted opening energy files
into binary formatted files. In this mode RNAplex does not compute
interactions.
.SS "Output:"
.IP
Options that modify the output
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-duplex\-distance\fR=\fIINT\fR
Distance between target 3' ends of two
consecutive duplexes
.IP
(default=`0')
.IP
Distance between the target 3'ends of two consecutive duplexes. Should be set
to the maximal length of interaction to get good results
.IP
Smaller z leads to larger overlaps between consecutive duplexes.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energy\-threshold\fR=\fIDOUBLE\fR Minimal energy for a duplex to be returned
(default=`\-100000')
.IP
Energy threshold for a duplex to be returned. The threshold is set on the
total energy of interaction, i.e. the hybridization energy corrected for
opening energy if \fB\-a\fR is set or the energy corrected by \fB\-c\fR. If unset, only the
mfe will be returned
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-produce\-ps\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Draw an alignment annotated interaction from
RNAplex
.IP
This option allows to produce interaction figures in PS\-format a la
RNAalifold, where base\-pair conservation is represented in color\-coded
format. In this mode no interaction are computed, but the \fB\-I\fR option indicates
the location of the file containing interactions between two RNA
(alignments/sequence) from a previous run. If the \fB\-A\fR option is not set a
structure figure a la RNAfold with color\-coded annotation of the
accessibilities is returned
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-WindowLength\fR=\fIINT\fR
Tells how large the region around the target
site should be for redrawing the alignment
interaction
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
This option allow to specify how large the region surrounding the target site
should be set when generating the alignment figure of the interaction
