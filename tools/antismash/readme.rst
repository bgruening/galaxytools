Galaxy wrapper for AntiSmash
=====================================

This wrapper is copyright 2012-2014 by Björn Grüning.

This is a wrapper for the command line tool of antiSMASH.

antiSMASH allows the rapid genome-wide identification, annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes.
It integrates and cross-links with a large number of in silico secondary metabolite analysis tools.

Installation
============

Galaxy should be able to automatically install the dependencies, i.e. the
'package_hmmer_3_0' or 'package_blast_plus_2_2_28' repository.

You must tell Galaxy about any system level Pfam databases using the configuration
file antismash.loc.

You can download the Pfam provided databases as compressed archives from here:

* ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/


External Data
=============

The antismash.loc file contains the path to a Pfam database.
For any other tool that also uses a Pfam database *.log file, you can sync or link both *.loc files.
