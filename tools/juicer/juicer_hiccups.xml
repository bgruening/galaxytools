            help="Maximum size of the submatrix within the chromosome passed on to GPU (Must be an even number greater than 40 to prevent issues from running the CUDA kernel). The upper limit will depend on your GPU. Dedicated GPUs should be able to use values such as 500, 1000, or 2048 without trouble. Integrated GPUs are unlikely to run sizes larger than 90 or 100. Matrix size will not effect the result, merely the time it takes for hiccups. Larger values (with a dedicated GPU) will run fastest." value="" />

Multiple resolutions can be specified using commas (e.g. 25000,10000,5000). Due to the nature of DNA looping, it is unlikely that loops will be found at lower resolutions (i.e. 50kB or 100kB) IMPORTANT: if multiple resolutions are used, the flags below can be configured so that different parameters are used for the different resolutions."/>

Four values must be given, separated by commas (e.g. 0.02,1.5,1.75,2). These thresholds (in order) represent: - threshold allowed for sum of FDR values of the horizontal, vertical, donut, and bottom left filters (an accepted loop must stay below this threshold) - threshold ratio that both the horizontal and vertical filters must exceed - threshold ratio that both the donut and bottom left filters must exceed - threshold ratio that at least one of the donut and bottom left filters must exceed"/>

        The required arguments are:

<HiC file(s)>: Address of HiC file(s) which should end with ".hic". This is the file you will load into Juicebox. URLs or local addresses may be used.

<outputLoopsList>: Final list of all loops found by HiCCUPS. Can be visualized directly in Juicebox as a 2D annotation. By default, various values critical to the HICCUPS algorithm are saved as attributes for each loop found. These can be disabled using the suppress flag below.

Defaults:

Medium resolution maps:
-m 512
-c (all chromosomes)
-r 10000
-k KR
-f .1
-p 2
-i 5
-t 0.02,1.5,1.75,2
-d 20000,20000,50000

High resolution maps:
-m 512
-c (all chromosomes)
-r 5000,10000
-k KR
-f .1,.1
-p 4,2
-i 7,5
