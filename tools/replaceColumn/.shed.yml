description: A tool to replace all column entries of a file given by values of a key-value file. 

long_description: |
  All entries of a column can be replaced by a given value. This value is determined with the key-value principle. 
  This is useful if someone wants to replace e.g. the chromosomes notation in ensembl notation by the ones from UCSC.
