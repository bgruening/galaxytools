# mOTUs: Metagenomic Operational Taxonomic Units Profiler
mOTUs is a computational tool designed for the taxonomic profiling of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic samples. It leverages marker gene-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) to identify and quantify microbial community composition, offering insights into microbial diversity and functional potential within various environments.

## Features
- **Taxonomic Profiling**: Identify the composition of microbial communities in the samples with high precision.
- **Quantitative Insights**: Estimate the relative abundance of identified taxa to understand community structure.
- **Broad Database**: Utilizes an extensive database comprising marker genes from thousands of microbial genomes.

## Usage
