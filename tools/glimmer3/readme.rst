Galaxy wrapper for Glimmer gene calling
=======================================

This wrapper is copyright 2012-2013 by Björn Grüning.

This is a wrapper for the command line tool of Glimmer3_.

Glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial DNA,
especially the genomes of bacteria, archaea, and viruses.
Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER) uses interpolated
Markov models (IMMs) to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA.
