**What it does**

By far, the most common question asked of two sets of genomic features is whether or not any of the features in the two sets “overlap” with one another. This is known as feature intersection. bedtools intersect allows one to screen for overlaps between two sets of genomic features. Moreover, it allows one to have fine control as to how the intersections are reported. bedtools intersect works with both BED/GFF/VCF and BAM files as input.

.. class:: infomark

Note that each BAM alignment is treated individually. Therefore, if one end of a paired-end alignment overlaps an interval in the BED file, yet the other end does not, the output file will only include the overlapping end.

.. class:: infomark

Note that a BAM alignment will be sent to the output file **once** even if it overlaps more than one interval in the BED file.
